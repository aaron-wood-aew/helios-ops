    # Proxy API requests to backend
    # This assumes backend is available at http://backend:8000
    # Ideally frontend should use relative paths /api/... which Nginx proxies
    # Currently frontend uses explicit http://localhost:8000
    # To make this seamless, we might need to update frontend to use /api prefix or relative paths.
    # For now, let's keep it simple. If frontend is built with env vars pointing to valid backend URL, fine.
    # But usually simpler to reverse proxy.
